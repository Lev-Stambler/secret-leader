\section{Preliminaries}
\subsection{Threshold FHE}
\cite{jain2017threshold} defines threshold FHE encryption. For the sake of completeness, we will define it here.

\begin{definition}[TFHE]
	Let $P = \set{P_1, ..., P_N}$	 be a set of $N$ parties and $\mathbb{S}$ be a class of
	access structures on $P$. A TFHE scheme for $\mathbb{S}$ is a tuple of PPT algorithms
	$$
		(\TFHESetup, \TFHEEncrypt, \TFHEEval, \TFHEPartDec, \TFHEFinDec)
	$$ such that the following specifications are met

	\begin{itemize}
		\item $(\TFHEPk, \TFHESk_1, ..., \TFHESk_N) \gets \TFHESetup(1^\lambda, 1^s, \mathbb{A})$:
		      Takes as input a security parameter $\lambda$, a depth bound on the circuit, and a structure $\mathbb{A} \in \mathbb{S}$.
		      Outputs a public key $\TFHEPk$ and a secret key $\TFHESk_i$ for each party $P_i$.
		\item $\ct \gets \TFHEEncrypt(\TFHEPk, \mu)$: Takes as input a public key and a message $\mu \in \set{0, 1}$ and outputs a ciphertext $\ct$.
		\item $\hat{\ct} \gets \TFHEEval(C, \ct_1, ..., \ct_k)$: Takes as input a circuit $C$ of depth at most $d$ and $k$ ciphertexts $\ct_1, ..., \ct_k$.
		      Outputs a ciphertext $\hat{\ct} = C(\ct_1, ..., \ct_k)$.
		\item $p_i \gets \TFHEPartDec(\ct, \TFHESk_i)$: Takes as input a ciphertext $\ct$ and a secret key $\TFHESk_i$ and outputs a partial decryption $p_i$.
		\item $\hat\mu \gets \TFHEFinDec(B)$: Takes as input a set $B = \set{p_i}_{i \in S}$ for some $S \subseteq [N]$ and deterministically
		      outputs a message $\hat\mu \in \set{0, 1, \bot}$.
	\end{itemize}
	% Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a FHE scheme with key generation algorithm 
\end{definition}

Further we remember the definitions of evaluation correctness and simulation security as outlined in,
\cite{boneh2020single}.

\begin{definition}[Evaluation Correctness \cite{boneh2020single}].
	We have that $\TFHE$ scheme is correct if
	for all $\lambda$, depth bounds $d$, access structure $\mathbb{A}$, circuit $C : \set{0, 1}^k \rightarrow \set{0, 1}$
	of depth at most $d$, $S \in \mathbb{A}$, and $\mu_i \in \set{0, 1}$, we have the following.
	For $(\TFHEPk, \TFHESk_1, ..., \TFHESk_N) \gets \TFHESetup(1^\lambda, 1^d, \mathbb{A})$,
	$\ct_i \gets \TFHEEncrypt(\TFHEPk, \mu_i)$ for $i \in [k]$, $\hat{\ct} \gets \TFHEEval(\TFHEPk, C, \ct_1, ..., \ct_k)$,
	\begin{equation*}
		\Pr\left[\TFHEFinDec(\TFHEPk,
			\set{\TFHEPartDec(\TFHEPk, \hat{\ct}, \TFHESk_i)}_{i \in S}) = C(\mu_1, ..., \mu_k)\right] = 1 - \negl(\lambda).
	\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Semantic Security]
	We have that a $\TFHE$ scheme satisfies semantic security for for all $\lambda$, and depth bound $d$ if the following holds. There is a stateful PPT algorithm
	$\mathcal{S} = (\mathcal{S}_1, \mathcal{S}_2)$ such that for any PPT adversary $\mathcal{A}$,
	the following experiment outputs 1 with negligible probability in $\lambda$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item On input $1^\lambda$ and depth $1^d$, the adversary outputs $\mathbb{A} \in \mathbb{S}$
		\item The challenger runs $(\TFHEPk, \TFHESk_1, ..., \TFHESk_N) \gets \TFHESetup(1^\lambda, 1^d, \mathbb{A})$ and provides $\TFHEPk$ to $\advers$.
		\item $\advers$ outputs a set $S \subseteq \set{P_1, ..., P_N}$ such that $\S \notin \mathbb{A}$.
		\item The challenger provides $\set{\TFHESk_i}_{i \in S}$ and $\TFHEEncrypt(\TFHEPk, \mu)$ to $\advers$ where $\mu \overset{\$}{\gets} \set{0, 1}$.
		\item $\advers$ outputs a guess $\mu'$. The experiment outputs 1 if $\mu' = \mu$.
	\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

\subsection{Data Independent Priority Queue}
In this work, we will use data independent queues as studied in \cite{toft2011secure, mitchell2014data, mazloom2023efficient}.
Data independent data structures are unique as their control flow and memory access do not depend on input data (\cite{mitchell2014data}).

\begin{definition}[Word RAM model \cite{mitchell2014data}]
	In the word RAM model, the RAM has a constant number of public and secret registers and can perform arbitrary operations on a constant number of registers in constant time.
\end{definition}

% TODO: slightly modified definition by me. Check with Mark and come back to it
\begin{definition}[Data Independent Data Structure \cite{mitchell2014data}]
	In the word RAM model, a data independent data structure is a collection of algorithms where
	all the algorithms uses RAM such that the RAM can only set its	control flow based on registers that are public.
\end{definition}

Data independent queues are especially useful as they allow for efficient computation within MPC and FHE as control flow is not dependent
on underlying ciphertexts data. We use a data independent queue as outlined in \cite{mazloom2023efficient}
which allows for
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\PQInsert$: Inserts a tag and value, $(p, x)$ into $\PQ$ according to the tag's priority.
	\item $\PQExtract$: Removes and returns the $(p, y)$ with highest tag priority.
	\item $\PQFront$: Returns the $(p, y)$ with highest tag priority without removing the element.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, we note that the order is stable. I.e.\ the first inserted among equal tagged elements has a higher priority.


\subsection{Resevoir Sampling}
Resevoir sampling is an online algorithm which allows for randomly selecting
$k$ elements from a stream of $n$ elements while using $\tilde{O}(k)$ space.
Algorithm R (\cite{vitter1985random}) is a simple algorithm which relies on a priority queue:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\ResevInsert(\mu_i, e_i, \texttt{coin}_i)$ where $\mu_i$ is $i$-th item, $e_i$ is independentally sampled randomness,
	and $\texttt{coin}_i$ is a random coin with probability $1/m$ of equaling 1.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item If $i \leq k$, insert the item into the queue along with $e_i$ as its tag via $\PQInsert(e_i, \mu_i)$.
		      \item If $i > k$ and $\texttt{coin}_i = 1$, replace the smallest labeled item in the queue with the new item if the coin is 1.
					\item If $i > k$ and $\texttt{coin}_i = 0$, do nothing.
	      \end{itemize}

	\item  $\mu_{a_1}, \mu_{a_2}, ..., \mu_{a_k} \gets \ResevOutput()$ where $a_1, ..., a_k$ are a uniformly random ordered susbset of $[n]$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Call $\PQExtract$ $k$ times setting $\mu_{a_\ell}$ to the $\ell$-th call to $\PQExtract$ where $\ell \in [k]$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
